  text('This is a project collecting the reviews on Google Map of a selected theater, and So I can use those data to illustrate some stories that record people s stories in there, like this ------------------Totally memorable experience in London s West End. Great venue for plays. Only seats under a thousand attendees, so not a bad seat anywhere. As a lifelong theatre-goer, I HAD to see a play and was NOT disappointed! Trafalgar Square is a trip in itself. Add the play, any one of them, a magical evening. Piccadilly is spotless, everyone is friendly & the memorabilia is not outrageously priced. Always a bonus! Highly recommend ALL West End theatre.',10, 10, 300, 400);
